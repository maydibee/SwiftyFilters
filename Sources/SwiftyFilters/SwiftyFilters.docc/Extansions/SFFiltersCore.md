# ``SFFiltersCore``

**The SFFiltersCore class is responsible for:**

- Tracking Filter State: It monitors whether any filters are active and notifies the root filters view when the filter state changes.
- Applying Filters: It applies the current filter state to your data, returning only the items that match the filter criteria.
- Resetting Filters: It provides a way to reset all filters to their initial state.
